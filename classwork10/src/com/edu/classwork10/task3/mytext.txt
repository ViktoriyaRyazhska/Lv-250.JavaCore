All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.
These unique names are called identifiers.
Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).

Example:
var price1 = 5;
var price2 = 6;
var total = price1 + price2;

The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:
- names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs;
- names must begin with a letter;
- names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial);
- names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables);
- reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names.
