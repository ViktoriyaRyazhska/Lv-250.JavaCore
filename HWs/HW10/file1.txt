We apologise for the recent downtime to the site. It happened that the appointed time to transfer ownership of the domain name from Jonathan to Peter and Amyas coincided with the premature birth of Amyas’s first child. As a result, things did not go quite as smoothly as we had hoped. Mother and daughter are both well, and the site should now be enjoying uninterrupted service once again.
